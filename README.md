# Angular First App Tutuorial 

This repo is a fork from the [Angular.io Tutorial](https://angular.io/start). The repo has been tweaked to run locally with newest versions of Node and npm. 

## Main Adjustments

<!-- * typescript: 3.3 -->
* TypeScript >=3.1.1 and <3.2.0
* zone.js: .10.1
* tsconfig comes from app not outside app.

## Setup and Serve

1. git clone
2. cd into directory
3. `npm i` to install dependencies
4. `npm install -g @angular/cli` to install the Angular CLI tools
5. `ng serve --open` to serve at port 4200
